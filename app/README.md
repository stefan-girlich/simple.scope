#simple.scope : app

##TODO


###bugs
* enter entry edit mode, try to drag-select text -> entry is drag-moved
* enter entry edit mode, drag entry, click label to enter edit mode again -> 3 clicks required, seems like invalid state

###usability
* decrease font size and margins
* decrease icon size
* pimp add panel
* put caret next to click for nicer editing
* basic keyboard support: create entry by ENTER press
* fix weird Apple Magic Mouse behaviour (disable or workaround easing)
* simple.scope logo in the bottom
* performance check


###basics
* create entry
* save entry label changes
* switch entry colors
* delete entries


###long term
* cross-browser
* mobile/touch? idea: extend default desktop UI objects to feature mobile specific behavior
* mobile native clients
* server storage
