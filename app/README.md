#simple.scope : app

##TODO

###usability
* put caret next to click for nicer editing
* basic keyboard support: create entry by ctrl+ENTER press
* fix weird Apple Magic Mouse behaviour (disable or workaround easing)
* simple.scope logo in the bottom
* performance check


###long term
* cross-browser
* mobile/touch? idea: extend default desktop UI objects to feature mobile specific behavior
* mobile native clients
* server storage
