#simple.scope : app

##TODO


###bugs


###usability
* delete separators right away, no safety
* pimp add panel
* put caret next to click for nicer editing
* basic keyboard support: create entry by ENTER press
* fix weird Apple Magic Mouse behaviour (disable or workaround easing)
* simple.scope logo in the bottom
* performance check


###basics
* switch entry colors


###long term
* cross-browser
* mobile/touch? idea: extend default desktop UI objects to feature mobile specific behavior
* mobile native clients
* server storage
